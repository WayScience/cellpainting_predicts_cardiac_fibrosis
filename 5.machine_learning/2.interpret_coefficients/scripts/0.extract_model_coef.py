# The coefficients from the machine learning model will either be positive (x > 0), where if the feature value increases, the more likely the feature is related to the Healthy cell type, negative (x < 0), where if the feature value increases, the more likely the feature is the Failing cell type, and zero (x = 0), where that feature has no impact on predicting if a cell is Healthy or Failing.
