# Evaluate models

In this submodule, we perform analyses to evaluate the performances of the models based on the training, testing, and holdout splits.

## PR Curves

We generate PR curves to assess how are models are performing between the training and testing splits.

## Confusion matrices

We generate confusion matrices to evaluate how well the model is accurately predicting the binary class (otherwise known as healthy versus failing).

## F1 scores

We generate bar plots of the weighted F1 scores to see how well the all features model is performing.

## Accuracy

We generate bar charts showing the accuracy of the models at predicting single-cells from each heart as the correct class (failing or healthy) across the data splits.
